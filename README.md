# ðŸŒŒ Nebula ERP v2

**Nebula ERP v2** is a modern rewrite of a college project originally developed for a Data Structures class at _The Catholic University of America_. The original version, built over six years ago, was an academic exploration of data structures and algorithms.

This v2 is a complete reimagining â€” rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on modular design, scalable architecture, and production-quality engineering practices. It reflects everything Iâ€™ve learned since then and serves as a personal challenge to build the system I always envisioned but didnâ€™t yet have the experience to create.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Nebula ERP v2 is an experimental **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system. While v1 was focused on demonstrating foundational data structures, **v2 is a clean-slate rewrite** with real-world principles in mind â€” including dependency injection, layered architecture, structured logging, and full testability.

### âœ… Project Goals

-   Rebuild the system with production-ready architecture
-   Preserve educational spirit while showcasing modern design patterns
-   Emphasize clean code and SOLID principles
-   Make all core components modular and swappable (e.g., repositories, logging providers)
-   Serve as a portfolio-quality, open-source ERP foundation
